# InsForge Backend-as-a-Service Development

Build full-stack applications with InsForge. This skill provides comprehensive guidance for:

- **Database**: CRUD operations, schema design, RLS policies, triggers
- **Authentication**: Sign up/in flows, OAuth, sessions, email verification
- **Storage**: File uploads, downloads, bucket management
- **Functions**: Serverless function deployment and invocation
- **AI**: Chat completions, image generation, embeddings
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections, subscriptions, event publishing
- **Deployments**: Frontend app deployment to InsForge hosting

## Key Distinction
- **Backend configuration**: Uses HTTP API calls to the InsForge project URL.
- **Client integration**: Uses the `@insforge/sdk` in application code.

## Usage
Access InsForge-specific guidance when:
- Setting up backend infrastructure (tables, buckets, functions, auth, AI)
- Integrating `@insforge/sdk` into frontend applications
- Implementing database CRUD operations with proper RLS
- Building authentication flows with OAuth and email verification
- Deploying serverless functions and frontend apps
