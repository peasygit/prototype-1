# Product Marketing Context

*Last updated: 2026-02-12*

## Product Overview
**One-liner:** Your Family's HR Consultant — Caring for People and Home (Hong Kong).
**What it does:** Peasy is a platform that matches Hong Kong families with Foreign Domestic Helpers (FDH) and manages the entire employment lifecycle—from AI-powered matching to contracts, visa processing with the Immigration Department, and payroll. It replaces traditional employment agencies (EAs) with a professional "Family HR" service.
**Product category:** Domestic Helper Platform / Family HR Solution
**Product type:** Marketplace + Service (Managed Marketplace)
**Business model:** Employer-paid service fees (Zero fees for helpers).

## Target Audience
**Target companies:** Hong Kong Households/Families (Employers) and Domestic Helpers (Candidates).
**Decision-makers:** Heads of household (Employers).
**Primary use case:** Finding trustworthy, compatible domestic help and managing the complex HK legal/administrative employment process.
**Jobs to be done:**
- Find a helper who fits our household lifestyle and personality.
- Handle the legal complexity (Standard Employment Contracts, Visa applications) without stress.
- Ensure fair and ethical treatment of the helper in compliance with HK Labour laws.
**Use cases:**
- Busy families needing childcare or elderly care.
- Households requiring general housekeeping and cooking.
- First-time employers unfamiliar with HK Labour Department regulations.
- Expats navigating the HK system for the first time.

## Personas
| Persona | Cares about | Challenge | Value we promise |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| **The Busy Parent** | Safety, reliability, speed | No time to vet candidates or manage Immigration paperwork; fears "bad matches." | Pre-vetted candidates, 24h matching, full admin support with Immigration Dept. |
| **The Ethical Employer** | Fairness, transparency | Dislikes exploitative agency fees; wants a happy helper. | Zero helper fees, fair contracts, "HR" standard. |
| **The Cultural Traditionalist** | Compatibility, harmony | Wants someone who fits the family "energy" (Wuxing/Zodiac). | Smart matching including cultural/personality compatibility. |
| **The Expat Family** | Compliance, English support | Confused by HK employment laws and Chinese forms. | Full English support, clear legal guidance, hassle-free processing. |

## Problems & Pain Points
**Core problem:** The traditional HK agency model is slow, opaque, expensive, and often exploitative (charging helpers illegal placement fees). DIY hiring is legally complex and risky due to strict Immigration rules.
**Why alternatives fall short:**
- **Traditional Agencies:** High fees for both sides, transactional, pushy, often non-compliant with "Zero placement fee" ethics, limited matching.
- **Direct Hire (DIY):** Overwhelming paperwork (ID 407 forms), visa risks, lack of vetting, confusion over "processed" vs "local" vs "overseas" hiring rules.
**What it costs them:** Time (interviews, queuing at Immigration), **Delay Risks** (Visa rejections due to form errors or missing documents), and money (agency fees).
**Emotional tension:** Fear of bringing the wrong person into the home; guilt over helper debt/fees; anxiety about legal compliance and "breaking contract" consequences.

## Competitive Landscape
**Direct:** Traditional Hong Kong Employment Agencies (street-level "Maid Agencies").
**Secondary:** Online classifieds/directories (HelperChoice, AsiaXPAT, Facebook groups) — falls short on vetting and end-to-end admin support.
**Indirect:** Daycare centers, cleaning services, nursing homes.

## Differentiation
**Key differentiators:**
- **"Family HR" Positioning:** We aren't just a matchmaker; we are your HR department (payroll, compliance with HK Labour Ordinance).
- **Zero Helper Fees:** Ethical stance that attracts better quality candidates (avoids debt-bondage common in HK).
- **Smart Matching:** AI-driven matching including personality, lifestyle, and Wuxing/Zodiac compatibility.
- **Bank-grade Compliance:** Secure handling of Standard Employment Contracts (SEC) and Visa applications.

**How we do it differently:** We use **AI-validation** to ensure forms (ID 407, 988A/B) are error-free before submission, eliminating delays caused by Immigration rejections—a common issue with manual agency processing.
**Why that's better:** Faster (24h matching), fairer (no debt for helpers), and safer (background verified).
**Why customers choose us:** For the peace of mind of a professional "HR" experience combined with the ease of an app.

## Objections
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Is it safe/legal?" | Yes, we operate in full compliance with HK Labour & Immigration Departments. |
| "Do you handle the consulate?" | Yes, we manage the entire process including Consulate notarization and Immigration submission. |
| "Why no helper fees?" | We believe in ethical employment; debt-free helpers are happier and more reliable. |
| "What if they break contract?" | We offer replacement guarantees and "HR" support to manage termination disputes. |
| "What is 'Fast Visa Processing'? Is it grey area?" | No. It means **efficiency, not shortcuts**. We use online submissions, AI-checked forms to prevent rejections, and prioritize "Finished Contract" candidates (already in HK) who can start in 2-4 weeks vs. 8-12 weeks for overseas hires. |

**Anti-persona:** Employers looking for the absolute cheapest "transactional" labor without regard for quality or ethics; those looking to bypass legal Minimum Allowable Wage (MAW).

## Switching Dynamics
**Push:** Frustration with agency fees, poor matches, helper turnover ("break contract"), and paperwork headaches.
**Pull:** "Peasy" experience, ethical branding, "HR consultant" professionalism.
**Habit:** "We've always used an agency."
**Anxiety:** "What if the visa gets rejected?" (We handle the process).
